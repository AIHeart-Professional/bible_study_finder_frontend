      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our Bible Study application was born from a simple belief: that everyone should have access to powerful tools 
        for studying God's Word. We combine modern technology with timeless wisdom to create an experience that helps 
        believers grow in their faith and understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a new believer taking your first steps in faith or a seasoned student of scripture, our platform 
        provides the resources and community support you need to deepen your relationship with God through His Word.
